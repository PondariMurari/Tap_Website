                        Java is an object-oriented language that encourages code 
                        reuse and modularity. Its platform independence allows 
                        Java code to run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
                        With robust memory management, exception handling, and a security manager, 
                        Java ensures secure and efficient coding</td>

                        Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language. It’s known for its “write once,
                         run anywhere” capability, meaning it can run on any device that has a 
                        Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java also offers robust security

                Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data 
                so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. 
                Algorithms, on the other hand, are a set of steps or rules
                to solve a particular problem. Together, they form the
                foundation of programming,enabling efficient problem-solving 
                and optimization in code.

                Building logic in programming involves understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller tasks,
                and implementing solutions for each task. It requires practice to translate real-world scenarios into code.
                Remember, there’s often more than one way to solve a problem in programming
