            and I em a fresher from ECE background. 
            I have been enrolled in tap academy since 
            may 2021 in full stack java development Course
            . This course has really helped me to achieve
             knowledge in java and other laguages like Html,
              Css and JavaScript. The augmented reality used
               by TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. 
               So from my point of view if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy, I will definitely suggest for this course because it's worthy</td>
        <td>Getting Enrolled in tap academy is 
            one my best decision. Clear understanding 
            of basics from Ims, consistent practice with 
            live class, daily signment gives boost,24 hrs
             doubt solving assistance from mentor,mock test
              every Friday and Saturday helps in self evaluation.
              For me till now it's been a great journey and daily
               I am learning something new and improving myself.
               I have no more fear of not getting a job because 
               after 2 months with tap academy I am getting various offers.

            Tap-Academy is the best e-learning platform.
            The concepts are taught very clearly and if 
            we are faced with any doubts they make sure 
            that,they clear the doubts. Tap Academy
             teaches using augmented reality, 
             which makes it is easier to grasp 
             and understand the concepts clearly.
              Friendly environment and the mentors 
              are easy to communicate.
